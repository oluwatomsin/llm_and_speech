Paris was amazing!
That was the trip of a lifetime! Thank you so much for taking me. My favorite
part was the Catacombs. So creepy! Or maybe it was Disneyland Paris. Every time I think of Disney,
I think of you. Remember when I you took me when I was 9? That was the best trip. Well,
maybe not the best. It’s not like we got to drink champagne cocktails at the foot of the Eiffel
Tower overlooking the Seine back then. But - different trips, different memories. I loved talking
to you about going to college in the fall. I don’t know exactly what I want to do when I’m done
college, but I do know that I have bigger dreams than just my small town and you get it. You’ve
been there, done that, escaped the small town. I’m nervous and excited too. I got assigned my first
ever roommate. I only know her name, not her picture or anything. I hope she doesn’t make too much
of a mess or want to go to bed at 9 pm or something. It’s too bad we didn’t get to go to the Louvre
and see the Mona Lisa though. Who couldn’t known it was closed on Mondays! Maybe we can go again
next summer to make up for it. JK! (But only kind of. Wouldn’t it be great?).
